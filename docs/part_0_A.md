## Part 0 (A): Preparation: get RottenPotatoes running locally

Whenever you start working on a Rails project, the first thing you should do is to run Bundler, to make sure all the app's gems are installed.  Switch to the app's root directory (presumably `rottenpotatoes-rails-intro`) and run `bundle install`.

Now create the local database schema using the provided [migration script](../db/migrate/20150809022253_create_movies.rb):

```sh
$ rake db:migrate
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> How does Rails decide where and how to create the development database?  (Hint: check the <code>db</code> and <code>config</code> subdirectories)</summary>
  <p><blockquote>The <code>rake db:migrate</code> command creates a local development database (following the specifications in <code>config/database.yml</code>) and runs the migrations in <code>db/migrate</code> to create the app's schema.  It also creates/updates the file <code>db/schema.rb</code> to reflect the latest database schema.  <strong>Note: it's important to keep this file under version control.</strong> </blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> What tables got created by the migrations?</summary>
  <p><blockquote>The <code>movies</code> table itself and the rails-internal <code>schema_migrations</code> table that records which migrations have been run.</blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

Now insert the [provided seed data](../db/seeds.rb) into the database (initial data items that the app needs to run). 

```sh
$ rake db:seed
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self Check Question:</strong> What seed data was inserted and where was it specified? (Hint: <code>rake -T db:seed</code> explains the seed task; <code>rake -T</code> explains other available Rake tasks)</summary>
  <p><blockquote>A set of movie data which is specified in <code>db/seeds.rb</code></blockquote></p>
</details>
<br />

At this point you should be able to run the app locally in your GitPod environment (`rails server`) and view it running by navigating to the GitPod instance URL `http://gitpod-instance-id/movies` in your browser.
